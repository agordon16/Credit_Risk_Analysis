# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to utilize machine learning models to predict credit risk. We will use several resampling algorithms, including oversampling, undersampling, combined approaches, and models that reduce bias, to make recommendations on which, if any, should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results
### Resampling Models
* Naive Random Oversampling
    This oversampling model produced a balanced accuracy score of 65.73%. This model also returned an overall precision score of .99, which seems to indicate an excellent predictive response rate. With an overall recall score of .60, this tends to lean towards a lower confidence in the accuracy of our data. Our F1 score in this model falls at .75 which is a decent score.  The lower recall score aligns with our accuracy score to indicate that, while this model **may** be effective, our client would like benefit from running their data through several different models.

* SMOTE Oversampling
    This model produced a balanced accuracy score of 66.22%, overall precision score of .99, and overall recall score of .69. An overall F1 score of .81 indicates a better model than our previous Naive Random Oversampling model. However, with a balanced accuracy score close to the previous model, we should continue to run the data through more models.

* Undersampling
    This model returned a balanced accuracy score of 55.41%, overall precision score of .99, and overall recall score of .69. An overall F1 score of .56 tends to indicate that this may not be the best predictive model to use.

* SMOTEENN
    This final model produced a balanced accuracy score of 68.76%, overall precision score of .99,  and overall recall score of .57. With an overall F1 score of .72, it falls below several of the other models analyzed and does not suggest this as the best model to use.

### Classifier Models
* Balanced Random Forest
    Our first classifier model returns a balanced accuracy score of 78.78%, an overall precision score of .99, and overall recall score of .91. An F1 score of .95 makes this a much better predictive model than the resampling models shown previously.

* Easy Ensemble Classifier
    This classifier model returns a balanced accuracy score of 92.54%, an overall precision score of .99, and overall recall score of .94. With an overall F1 score of .97, this appears to be the best of our tested models.

## Summary
After reviewing the array of machine learning models used to analyze credit risk data, it would appear the Easy Ensemble Classifier provides the best results. That being said, we must keep in mind the disparity in data set size. This disparity leads to the idea that more research for a better model is warranted.
